# Welcome to my Weather Tracking App!

A short demo can be found [here](https://share.getcloudapp.com/DOuqwgqY).

This is a single page application used to display a 7 day forecast of Washington D.C.
The app uses the [7timer weather API](http://www.7timer.info/), specifically using [CIVILLight](http://www.7timer.info/index.php?product=civillight&lon=-86.7050248046875&lat=36.46607855999758&lang=en&tzshift=0).

To run this project, download the code and run:
```javascript
  npm install
  npm start
```

## User Stories:
  * A user should be able to see seven days of weather forecast starting with the current day of Washington D.C.
  * A user should be able to click on a specific day and see a modal with more information about the weather that day
    * A user should be able to click the background or the x to exit from that modal 
  * Depending on the time of day, a user should be able to see different background images, and weather images for the forecasts


This was a very fun app to build. My challenge was to create it in 48 hours. Given more time I would have liked to flesh out more aspects of the detailed modal and also refactor the app to make things a bit more consice.
